# Andy's MDA Project

This repository will contain the mini data analysis project for STAT 545A class. My project is looking at the data on apartment buildings. The main overarching research question that I am exploring in this project is "Are newer apartments better? I will be performing various tasks and exercises in each of the Milestones to help me answer this question. There will be a release for each milestone and you can find the .Rmd and .md file in each of them. Check tags for any newer release/update on the project.

There are 3 folders: Milestone 1, Milestone 2, and output

Milestone 1 folder will have the .Rmd and .md files for milestone 1.

Milestone 2 folder will have the .Rmd and .md files for milestone 2.

output folder will have the outputs created from Task 4 in Milestone 2, which is a .csv file of one of my summarized tables in Milestone 2 that describes the fire alarm counts in the apartments, and also a linear regression model saved as an .rds file.
